## Desklutter

While I'm working during the day I frequently use my Desktop for saving all sorts of files or systematizing my current work. As a result at the end of the day I end up with a Desktop that is fully cluttered with files and folders. So I decided to built a small Desktop app to move all those into a folder for me at a scheduled time.

- Python 3.6
